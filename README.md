Just a small project I worked on over the weekend over the course of a few hours.
This project is nothing special I just wanted to implement mergesort in a few different
ways according to the wikipedia page on it.

I didn't include the compiled file because cpp compiles platform-specifically.
When compiling keep in mind to use -pthread flag or equivalent on windows.
